# Snow Leopard - AI-Powered Writing Assistant

## What is Snow Leopard?
Snow Leopard is an intelligent writing environment designed to enhance your writing process with AI capabilities. It provides a seamless interface for document creation, editing, and collaboration, augmented by AI suggestions, content generation, and contextual chat.

## Why Snow Leopard?
Modern writing tools often lack deep AI integration or are closed-source. Snow Leopard aims to provide:

‚úÖ **Open-Source & Extensible** ‚Äì Transparent development and easy integration.
ü¶æ **AI Driven** - Enhance your writing with AI suggestions, generation, and chat context.
üîí **Data Privacy Focused** ‚Äì Your documents, your data. Designed with privacy in mind.
‚öôÔ∏è **Self-Hosting Option** ‚Äì Flexibility to run your own instance (details TBD).
üìÑ **Rich Document Editing** ‚Äì Supports various content types and formats.
üé® **Modern UI & UX** ‚Äì Clean, intuitive interface built with Shadcn UI and TailwindCSS.
üöÄ **Developer-Friendly** ‚Äì Built with Next.js and Drizzle for easy customization.

## Tech Stack
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI:** React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
*   **Authentication:** Better Auth
*   **AI Integration:** [Specify your AI provider/library, e.g., Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI, Anthropic]


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js:** v18 or higher
*   **pnpm:** v8 or higher (Recommended package manager)
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** v20 or higher

### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> # Replace with your repository URL
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   **Crucially, update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`** to match the Docker Compose setup:
        ```dotenv
        # .env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/cursorforwriting_db"
        ```
    *   Configure other necessary variables (like `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, AI provider keys, etc.) as described in the **Environment Variables** section below.

3.  **Start the Database**
    *   Ensure Docker is running.
    *   Start the PostgreSQL database service defined in `docker-compose.yml`:
        ```bash
        docker compose up -d db
        ```
    *   Wait a few moments for the database container to initialize.

4.  **Apply Database Schema**
    *   Push the schema defined in `lib/db/schema.ts` to the running database:
        ```bash
        pnpm db:push
        ```
    *   This command uses Drizzle Kit to synchronize your database schema with your code definition.

5.  **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

6.  **Open in Browser**
    Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Environment Variables
Configure the following in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
# Database (Required - Ensure this matches your docker-compose.yml)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/cursorforwriting_db"

# Better Auth (Required)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="" # Generate a strong secret (e.g., using `openssl rand -hex 32` or via the Better Auth website: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation)
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Base URL of your app

# Resend API (Required for Feedback - if using feedback feature)
RESEND_API_KEY="" # Your Resend API key

# AI Provider(s) (Required for AI features - add/remove as needed)
# Example for OpenAI:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=""
# Example for Groq:
# GROQ_API_KEY="" # Get your key at https://console.groq.com/keys
# Example for Fireworks:
# FIREWORKS_API_KEY=""

# Add other necessary environment variables
```

### Database

*   **Start Local DB:** `docker compose up -d db`
*   **Stop Local DB:** `docker compose down`
*   **Connect String:** Ensure `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points to your PostgreSQL instance.
*   **Apply Schema/Migrations:** `pnpm db:push` (for simple schema sync based on `schema.ts`).
*   **For production or more complex changes, use migrations:**
    *   Generate Migration Files: `pnpm db:generate` (Run after changing `lib/db/schema.ts`).
    *   Apply Migrations: `pnpm db:migrate` (Runs migration files).
*   **DB Studio (Optional):** `pnpm db:studio` (Opens Drizzle Studio web UI).

### Authentication (Better Auth)

*   **Secret:** Set a strong `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` in your `.env` file (see Environment Variables section for generation methods).
*   **Adapter:** Configured in `lib/auth.ts` to use the Drizzle adapter with PostgreSQL.
*   **Schema:** Better Auth requires specific tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`). These are already defined in `lib/db/schema.ts`. Running `pnpm db:push` (as part of the setup steps) uses Drizzle Kit to push this combined schema (your app's tables + Better Auth tables) to the database. You do not need to use the `@better-auth/cli` for schema management when using the Drizzle adapter with a pre-defined schema like this. For more details, see the Better Auth documentation: [https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation)

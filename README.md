# Snow Leopard - AI-Powered Writing Assistant

## What is Snow Leopard?
Snow Leopard is an intelligent writing environment designed to enhance your writing process with AI capabilities. It provides a seamless interface for document creation, editing, and collaboration, augmented by AI suggestions, content generation, and contextual chat.

## Why Snow Leopard?
Modern writing tools often lack deep AI integration or are closed-source. Snow Leopard aims to provide:

‚úÖ **Open-Source & Extensible** ‚Äì Transparent development and easy integration.
ü¶æ **AI Driven** - Enhance your writing with AI suggestions, generation, and chat context. Using Vercel's AI SDK. 
üîí **Data Privacy Focused** ‚Äì Your documents, your data. Designed with privacy in mind.
‚öôÔ∏è **Self-Hosting Option** ‚Äì Flexibility to run your own instance.
üìÑ **Rich Document Editing** ‚Äì Supports various content types and formats.
üé® **Modern UI & UX** ‚Äì Clean, intuitive interface built with Shadcn UI and TailwindCSS.
üöÄ **Developer-Friendly** ‚Äì Built with Next.js and Drizzle for easy customization.

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js:** v18 or higher
*   **pnpm:** v8 or higher (Recommended package manager)
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** v20 or higher

### Setup (Monorepo)

This project uses a monorepo structure managed by pnpm workspaces:
*   `apps/snow-leopard`: The Next.js web application.
*   `packages/db`: Shared database schema, client, and migration logic.

1.  **Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies (from Root)**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> # Replace with your repository URL
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    pnpm install # Run from the root directory!
    ```
    This installs dependencies for all apps and packages and links them together.

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables (Two Files)**
    *   Copy the example environment files:
        ```bash
        # For the Next.js app
        cp apps/snow-leopard/.env.example apps/snow-leopard/.env
        
        # For Drizzle Kit migrations/generation
        cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env 
        ```
    *   **Crucially, edit BOTH `.env` files** and ensure the `DATABASE_URL` matches the Docker Compose setup:
        ```dotenv
        # In BOTH apps/snow-leopard/.env AND packages/db/.env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/cursorforwriting_db"
        ```
    *   Configure other necessary variables (like `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, AI provider keys, etc.) **only** in `apps/snow-leopard/.env` as described in the **Environment Variables** section below.

3.  **Start the Database (from Root)**
    *   Ensure Docker is running.
    *   Start the PostgreSQL database service defined in the root `docker-compose.yml`:
        ```bash
        docker compose up -d db
        ```
    *   Wait a few moments for the database container to initialize.

4.  **Apply Database Schema (from Root)**
    *   Push the schema defined in `packages/db/src/schema.ts` to the running database using the root script:
        ```bash
        pnpm db:push
        ```
    *   This command now filters to the `packages/db` package and runs its migration script.

5.  **Start the Development Server (from Root)**
    *   Start the Next.js app using the root script:
        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```
    *   This command now filters to the `apps/snow-leopard` package and runs its `dev` script.

6.  **Open in Browser**
    Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Environment Variables
Configure the following primarily in your **`apps/snow-leopard/.env`** file:

```dotenv
# Database (Required for App - Ensure this matches your docker-compose.yml & packages/db/.env)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/cursorforwriting_db"

# Better Auth (Required)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="" # Generate a strong secret (e.g., using `openssl rand -hex 32` or via the Better Auth website: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation)
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Base URL of your app

# Resend API (Required for Feedback - if using feedback feature)
RESEND_API_KEY="" # Your Resend API key

# AI Provider(s) (Required for AI features - add/remove as needed)

# Example for Groq:
# GROQ_API_KEY="" # Get your key at https://console.groq.com/keys


# Add other necessary environment variables for the app
```

**Note:** The `packages/db/.env` file only needs the `DATABASE_URL` for Drizzle Kit commands.

### Database

*   **Location:** Schema (`src/schema.ts`), Client (`src/index.ts`), and Migrations (`migrations/`) are located in the `packages/db` directory.
*   **Start Local DB:** `docker compose up -d db` (from root)
*   **Stop Local DB:** `docker compose down` (from root)
*   **Apply Schema/Migrations (from Root):** `pnpm db:push` (for simple schema sync based on `schema.ts`).
*   **For production or more complex changes, use migrations (run from Root):**
    *   Generate Migration Files: `pnpm db:generate` (Run after changing `packages/db/src/schema.ts`).
    *   Apply Migrations: `pnpm db:migrate` (Runs migration files in `packages/db/migrations`).
*   **DB Studio (Optional - from Root):** `pnpm db:studio` (Opens Drizzle Studio web UI connected via `packages/db/.env`).

### Authentication (Better Auth)

*   **Secret & URL:** Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` in your `apps/snow-leopard/.env` file.
*   **Adapter:** Configured in `apps/snow-leopard/lib/auth.ts` to use the Drizzle adapter, importing the `db` client from `@snow-leopard/db`.
*   **Schema:** Better Auth requires specific tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`). These should be defined in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`. Running `pnpm db:push` (from the root) uses Drizzle Kit within the `packages/db` context to push the combined schema to the database.
